Subject: [Smeagol-discuss] Marie Curie Fellowship
Message-ID: <4BCC246D.1070901@tcd.ie>

Dear Smeagol Fellows,

The Smeagol team will be happy to sponsor training periods in its three 
sites (Dublin, Lancaster and Oviedo), through the Marie Curie scheme 
(see http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/dc/index.cfm). These can range from 12 
to 24 months and will be sponsored by the EU. Two schemes are open to 
people of ANY nationality:

1) Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship 
(http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=UserSite.FP7DetailsCallPage&call_id=244#infopack), 
for candidates moving from an EU country.

2) Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship 
(http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=UserSite.FP7DetailsCallPage&call_id=242#infopack) 
  for candidates moving from OUTSIDE EU country.

There will be a rather severe competition for these awards, so only 
candidates with a strong CV will stand good chances of success. If you 
are interested in this possibility, please get in touch with the 
coordinator of the node you wish to join:

Dublin, Prof. Stefano Sanvito (sanvitos at tcd.ie)
Lancaster: Prof. Colin Lambert (c.lambert at lancaster.ac.uk)
Oviedo: Prof. Jaime Ferrer (ferrer at condmat.uniovi.es)

Best Wishes,

The Smeagol team
