Dear Colleague,
The 2016 International Conference on Systems and Informatics (ICSAI 2016) will be held from 19-21 November 2016 in Shanghai, China. 
ICSAI 2016 aims to be a premier international forum for scientists and researchers to present the state of the art of systems engineering and information science. 
Topics include (but are not limited to): 
      Systems
?       Control and Automation Systems
?       Power and Energy Systems
?       Intelligent Systems
?       Computer Systems and Applications

All papers in conference proceedings will be submitted to both IEEE Xplore and EI Compendex for indexing. Substantially extended versions of best papers will be considered for publication in a special issue of a SCI-indexed journal.
Shanghai is the largest city in China, with famous historical and cultural heritage. Attractions include Yuyuan Garden ("Happy Garden" built in Ming Dynasty), Shanghai Museum with 120,000 pieces of rare relics, Shanghai World Financial Center, Jade Buddha Temple (Song Dynasty), Oriental Pearl TV Tower, Zhujiajiao Water Town, and Expo 2010 site. 
To promote international participation of researchers from outside the country/region where the conference is held (i.e., China?s mainland), researchers outside of China?s mainland are encouraged to propose invited sessions. The first author of each paper in an invited session must not be affiliated with an organization in China?s mainland. All papers in the invited sessions can be marked as "Invited Paper". The organizer(s) for each invited session with at least 6 registered papers will jointly enjoy an honorarium of US*D 400. Invited session organizers will solicit submissions, conduct reviews and recommend accept/reject decisions on the submitted papers. Invited session organizers will be able to set their own submission and review schedules, as long as a list of recommended papers is determined by 10 October 2016. Each invited session proposal should include: (1) the name, bio, and contact information of each organizer of the invited session; (2) the title and a short synopsis of the invited session. Please send your proposal to icsai2016 at sdju.edu.cn
