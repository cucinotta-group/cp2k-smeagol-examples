Subject: [Smeagol-discuss] some about smeagol installation
Message-ID: <19e08d4.7a70.128ba4480a8.Coremail.lvxiaoling2009@126.com>

Dear Prof. Sanvitos:

I am a student in Prof. Zheng Yisong's group. Our group has justed obtained the licence of Smeagol from You. I have downloaded the smeagol several days ago. And we are trying our best to install it. At the same time we have encountered a lot of trouble . We hope to gain some advices from you.

First I want to show some our information to you.. The system of our server is redhat enterprise 4..2.1.8 ,and we also installed mkl_10.0 , ifort_9.0 and openmpi-1.4.2.

And then we followed the ?README??modified the arch.make(intel-mkl-make) and Makefile as in attachment.

Then the termi occurred no mistake-tips , but we are not sure whether it is successful.How can we test it? We output them in a file also being attached in attachment(make_output).

The most strange thing which touble me a long time is that there occured a executable file called '-vaxlib' when 'make'is over. But We couldn?t find the smeagol executable file .Is me wrong.

Could you please to give me some advices on such problems. Many thanks.
Best wishes

Sincerely Yours
Lv Xiaoling

Subject: [Smeagol-discuss] some wrong with *.psf file
Message-ID: <39bb89c3.741a.128ce493a34.Coremail.lvxiaoling2009@126.com>

Dear all
I have installed the smeagol . But when I run it ,there ocurred some wrong with it . I check my mpich and I think there's nothing wrong with it. I am in trouble Whether smeagol need *.psf file . I didn't give it this file, I think smeagol can find it automatically.
Termi ocurred the below information.
read_pseudo: ERROR: Pseudopotential file not found: Mg.psf              
Stopping Program
MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 0 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 1.
NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.

Of course, you should put the *.psf file in the same directory where 
your input file lies.  Smeagol cannot find it automatically.

Dear Lv Xiaoling,

you have to add the following lines to your arch.make file:

SOURCE_DIR= ../
EXEC = smeagol

Cheers,

Ivan
