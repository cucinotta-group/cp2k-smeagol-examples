Subject: [Smeagol-discuss] question about smeagol-run error
Message-ID: <CAJSCAS1-6Ce2_hsFOo433iFhigznzQtzKTUPsopzsW0P6YB=Ug@mail.gmail.com>

Dear:

I met some questions when I calculate Si using smeagol.
my fdf input used is attached.(silicon.long.fdf)
Pseudo-potential input I used also attached.(Si.psf)
there's some output I get:
first is silicon.out like attached.
second is output.out attached also.
I have confused for several days and I can't figure out what's the problem.
hope there's somebody that can help me solve the problem.
thanks

Hi,

The unit cell along transport direction is too short, so there is an
overlap to the next nearest cell. If you double the unit cell along
transport direction then it should be work. This is also mentioned in the
last three lines of silicon.out file.

Dear:

Thank you for your reply.
I enlarge my unit cell by changing my unit cell

from

%endblock AtomicCoordinatesAndAtomicSpecies

to

  0.750   0.750   0.250    1   Si
%endblock AtomicCoordinatesAndAtomicSpecies

but it still appears the error.
Is my way to changing the unit cell wrong?
thank you!

Is the error same as before? Can you also send the input and output files?
By the way you need to increase the unit cell only along the transport
direction (z), although increasing it along other directions should not
really cause an error.
One more thing: the coordinates need to be sorted in increasing order along
z direction.

Okay, you can try increasing the number of unit cells along z to four times
the primitive cell and then most likely it will get rid of this error.

To increase the cell only along one direction you can use one of the
visualization codes, for example xcrysden and then you can multiply along
any of the directions (for this you would need to convert the coordinates
to xsf format):

Dear:

yes, the error is the same.
the files attached is my input(Si.long.fdf and Si.psf) and output(Si.out
and output.out)
I think maybe output.out is the error for my compiling.

Can I ask a stupid question? How to increase the unit cell only along the
transport direction (z)?

Dear:

I have enlarged my unit cell six times and it still appears the error.
I have found another solution on the website.(as below)
http://lists.tchpc.tcd.ie/pipermail/smeagol-discuss/2007-September/000310.html
I reduce my basic set by using
PAO.BasisSize       DZ
PAO.EnergyShift     200 meV
originally I use default value( 0.02Ry=272meV)
but the error still occur...
I don't know why and I really have no idea...

hope to get your or somebody's respnse that can help me solve the
problem...!
thank you!

Dear:

I modified my compilation and used your input file to calculate on smeagol.
It works. but after one minute, the job will become a zombie, which means
the job is still calculation but there is no output.
I have checked the situation of the job and it shows the job have used 99%
CPU and 0.2 memory.
it seems normal, but there just still no output after two hours past.
have you ever seen this problem before?
thank you!

Dear:

I modified my compilation and used your input file to calculate on smeagol.
It works. but after one minute, the job will become a zombie, which means
the job is still calculation but there is no output.
I have checked the situation of the job and it shows the job have used 99%
CPU and 0.2 memory.
it seems normal, but there just still no output after two hours past.
have you ever seen this problem before?
thank you!

Subject: [Smeagol-discuss] question about smeagol-run error
Message-ID: <CAJSCAS1u7CCQzNaBmyeNGGoxT20vgbZ6WiJ1H1wndCiddAv88w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear:

I modified my compilation and used your(correct) input file to calculate on
smeagol.
It works. but after one minute, the job will become a zombie, which means
the job is still calculation but there is no output.
I have checked the situation of the job and it shows the job have used 99%
CPU and 0.2 memory.
it seems normal, but there just still no output after two hours past.
have you ever seen this problem before?
thank you!

Dear:

So when you calculate Si using my input file successfully,
is there any DAT,HSL,DM file output?

thank you

Yes, if the leads calculation finishes correctly, one should obtain
bulklft.DAT, bulkrgt.DAT, Systemlabel.HST and Systemlabel.DM files, as also
mentioned in the smeagol user manual.
Regarding, your previous question about the job becoming a zombie I don't
think I have seen this before and cannot really help. One option might be
to try running in serial.

Subject: [Smeagol-discuss] can smeagol calculate the force on atom when
	there's bias?
Message-ID: <CAJSCAS1unGa29RgDb0K60AdALOd3uAZsWdO1Sijpd+8LfUMd3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear:

Since I need to calculate the relation for force and bias.
can smeagol calculate the force on atom when there's bias?
How to calculate and Where to check?
I have search on the Internet and it seems smeagol can not calculate force
but I'm not sure.
it said that I need to calculate Siesta for the force under different bias?

Thanks!

Dear:

When I calculated my model using smeagol with MPI,
at first it was normal ,
but then it end with some problem like the file attached.
Can anyone help me what's the problem?

Dear:

I have found a paper that it is possible to  calculating current induced
forces in Smeagol.
http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.84.085445
it said that:
The possibility of calculating current induced forces is now a reality in
Smeagol. A new work, published in Phys. Rev. B this week [Phys. Rev. B 84,
085445 (2011)], demonstrates the implementation of a current induced forces
algorithm in Smeagol. As a demonstration we have evaluated the migration
barriers for Si adatoms on C-nanotubes and demonstrated that Si can be
moved efficiently at relatively moderate current densities. Problems such
as electron-migration can now be tackled with first principles methods.

Is this implemented in the smeagol version1.2?
or I must use density matrix calculate in smeagol to calculate the force?

thank you
