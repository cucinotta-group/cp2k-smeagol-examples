	China [Submitting to IEEE Xplore/ISI/Ei]

Dear Colleague,

We cordially invite you to submit a paper to the upcoming 2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI 2016), to be held in Datong, China, 15-17 October 2016. Due to numerous requests, the submission deadline is extended to 10 July 2016.

Datong, situated in the north of Shanxi Province, was the capital of the Northern Wei dynasty (383-534 AD). The city is endowed with rich cultural relics, such as Yungang Grottos (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), Yingxian Wooden Pagoda (built in 1056, 221 feet tall), Hanging Temple, Nine Dragon Screen, Huayan Temple, and Datong Great Wall.

As with past CISP-BMEI conferences, all papers in conference proceedings will be submitted to both EI Compendex and ISTP, as well as IEEE Xplore (All CISP-BMEI 2008-2014 papers have already been indexed by EI Compendex and included in IEEE Xplore. All CISP-BMEI 2015 papers have now been included in IEEE Xplore and submitted to EI Compendex). Substantially extended versions of best papers will be considered for publication in a CISP-BMEI special issue of a SCI-indexed journal. CISP-BMEI 2016 is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (pending). The past conference proceedings from 2008 to 2015 appeared as 2 separate (but co-located) conferences, i.e., CISP and BMEI. This is the first time that CISP-BMEI is merged as a single conference.

CISP-BMEI 2016 is a premier international forum for scientists and researchers to present the state of the art of multimedia, signal processing, biomedical engineering and informatics. The registration fee of US*D480 includes proceedings, lunches, dinners, banquet, coffee breaks, and all technical sessions.

To promote international participation of researchers from outside the country/region where the conference is held (i.e., China's mainland), researchers outside of China's mainland are encouraged to propose invited sessions. The first author of each paper in an invited session must not be affiliated with an organization in China's mainland. All papers in the invited sessions can be marked as "Invited Paper". The organizer(s) for each invited session with at least 6 registered papers will jointly enjoy an honorarium of US*D 500. Invited session organizers will solicit submissions, conduct reviews and recommend accept/reject decisions on the submitted papers. Invited session organizers will be able to set their own submission and review schedules, as long as a list of recommended papers is determined by 18 August 2016. Each invited session proposal should include: (1) the name, bio, and contact information of each organizer of the invited session; (2) the title and a short synopsis of the invited session. Please send your proposal to cisp-bmei at tyut.edu.cn
