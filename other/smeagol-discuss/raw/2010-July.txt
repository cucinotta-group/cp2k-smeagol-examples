I have got problem  about Smeagol installation. I have 
tried with different arch.make
files and I have repeated 
installation process too many times but I don't know what is wrong.

Unlike the 
SmeagolI have installed Siesta independently in which I 
can run all examples.

My system is a dual core 
intel with ubuntu linux operating system where the
compiler is gfortarn and 
lapack and blas libs have been located in /usr/lib.

I would grateful if you provide me 
anarch.make and Makefile for a parallel or even sequential 
(which is better 
for me)installation.



Best regards
Arash Phirouznia

Subject: [Smeagol-discuss] problem regarding convergence for antiparallel
	spin confi
Message-ID: <1278335765.4c31db15bf24a@mercury.jncasr.ac.in>


Dear All,

I have done the calculations for Nickel leads with parallel spin
configuration and these calculations have converged well. For the
calculations with antiparallel spin configuration of the leads, I
started
the transport calculations using the spin up leads files for left lead
and
spindown leads for the right lead. My calculations donot seem to
converge
at all. I tried playing around with the DMmixingweight but even that
doesnot help. The values of dHMmax go down to 6*10^-3 and then starts
increasing steadily. Sometimes the convergence blows up and even the
value
in the .CHR file changes a lot. In these calculations, while doing the
siesta run for
the scattering region of the system I just put the spin-polarisation
flag
to true, I didnot specify the spin on the parts of the leads in the
scattering region to be antiparallel by hand. Do I need to do that?

Please help me regarding this.

thanking you,

Kanchan Ulman

Dear Kanchan,

  for anti-parallel calculations you have to set the initial spin by 
hand in the initspin block, + for the left Ni atoms and - for the right 
Ni atoms (assuming the left leads is up and the right lead is down). For 
the other molecules you don't have to initialize the spin. It is very 
likely that if you don't do that the calculations does not converge 
(even if it would converge the result would not be correct if you don't 
initialize  correctly the Ni electrodes up and down).

Cheers,

Ivan

Hi Guangping

I'm not sure if people are still interested in this.

I've been looking into doing some of this testing and benchmarking. I've been building up some tools to build compilers and support libraries etc... such that it is possible to tests different compilers, mpi implementations and libraries.

I will be using test data sets that Ivan has provided.

Regards,
Jimmy Tang
