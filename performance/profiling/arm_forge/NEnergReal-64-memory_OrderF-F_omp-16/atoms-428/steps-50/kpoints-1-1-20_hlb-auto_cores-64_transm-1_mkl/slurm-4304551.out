===================================================================
The Allinea Sampler has limited support for MPI when thread support
is set to MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED or MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE (as specified
in the call to MPI_Init_thread).
Only MPI communication on the main thread will appear in the MPI
metrics graph. Time spent in MPI calls on non-main threads will be
reported as MPI-time (vs compute-time) but the MPI calls from those
threads will not contribute to the metric graphs.
The fully supported arguments to MPI_Init_thread are MPI_THREAD_SINGLE
(only one thread will execute) and MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED (if the
process is multithreaded, only the main thread will make MPI
calls).
