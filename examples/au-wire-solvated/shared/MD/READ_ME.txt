It should be noted that the AIMD run didnt converge after 8.9 ps, and restart files were kept every few ps.
It is recommended to restart the simulation from the restart file in which the time start eval was around 5-6 ps. Unless the 8ps one is there and I missed it :)
If you decide to restart and get to around 8.9 ps and it doesnt converge. I recommend changing pre-conditioner conditions and type.
I have saved some of the trajectory files and you can contact me for them.
